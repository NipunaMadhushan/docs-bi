# Build Local Connectors

APIs power many of the digital services we use dailyâ€”notifications, SMS alerts, reminders, and transactions. These services often expose hundreds of operations via their APIs, making manual coding of client logic tedious and error-prone.

To simplify this, BI allows you to generate local connectors automatically from a valid OpenAPI specification. 

1\. Open your BI project and select to add a `Local Connector` from the left-hand panel.

2\. Provide a name for the connector and upload the OpenAPI specification. The system will then generate the local connector based on the uploaded specification.

3\. Then you can use the generated local connector within your BI integration.
