# Managing Configurations

Configurability in WSO2 Integrator: BI allows users to modify integration behavior using external inputs without changing the source code. It is powered by Ballerinaâ€™s built-in support for configurable variables, enabling runtime configuration of module-level values.

Consider the following step-by-step guide to configuring a Ballerina package that contains an HTTP service.

1. Create an HTTP service using the default configurations in BI.

2. Create a type `Greeting` that holds the greeting information.

3. Create a configurable variable to hold the greeting to be sent when invoking the API endpoint. This can be done by adding a `Configuration` in `WSO2 Integrator: BI` design view.

4. Run the integration. You'll be prompted to create a `Config.toml`. This file can contain the greeting information. This allows configuring the values externally during the runtime.

This concept of configurables can be used to hold environment specific variables that needs to be updated at the time of execution.
